# ML Engineering Tips Radar - Releases of MlFlow 1.8 and Tensorflow 2.2.0

A couple of highlights for me of the week relevant to the ML Engineering comunity :

## Release of MLFLow 1.8 
More details available in (https://mlflow.org/news/2020/04/21/1.8.0-release/index.html) . A couple of noticeable things for me 
are the following :

* Addition of Spacy Models on automated loading mode
* Health check endpoint API
* Ability to send arguments on the Creation of a Docker image


## Release of Tensorflow 2.2.0  
Didn't notice any thing significantly improvements apart from iterative improvements and loads of bug fixes.

I am currently evaluating Kubeflow will post some tips in the blog during the week.
