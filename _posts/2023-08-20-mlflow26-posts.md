# Notes Mlflow 2.6.0 - API Gateway (Experimental ) - Part I 

I am definitely impressed with the new capabilities announced on Mlflow 2.6.0 around an API Gateway , i have not tested yet.

Using this article to figure ou the main capabilities of it, as far as i can see i can see the ability to :

1. Abstract multiple LLMs API's

2. Provide some Governance

3. Fastrack the creation and deployment of LLM projects

On the next notes i will start playing with it.
