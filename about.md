# About me


![Here I am](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1138050464573022208/llhmkn26_400x400.png)

My name is Natu Lauchande i am currently a Data / ML Engineer with experience in Fintech/Ecommerce/Cloud space. At heart, I enjoy coding Distributed/Data/ML systems with cool/motivated people rallying around a challenging effort that makes the world a better place.  "It always seems impossible until it is done" & "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one" are catchphrases that I aspire to live by in the endeavors that I take part in.

Along the way had the opportunity to be granted a patent(co-inventor) in distributed systems while working at Amazon (https://patents.google.com/patent/US9674275B1/en) , publish in a top academic journal( https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/5/1309/621438) and contribute to open-source software. I have recently also been very active as a speaker in ML/Tech conferences and meetups.
