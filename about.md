# About me


![Here I am](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1138050464573022208/llhmkn26_400x400.png)

My name is Natu Lauchande i am currently a Principal Engineer in the Fintech space. At heart, I enjoy coding Distributed/Data/ML systems with cool/motivated people rallying around a challenging effort that makes the world a better place.  "It always seems impossible until it is done" & "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one" are catchphrases that I aspire to live by in the endeavors that I take part in.

Currently tackling problems in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Distributed Systems. I had the privilege of working in diverse industries ranging from biomedical/pharma/vaccine research, cloud, fintech, and e-commerce/mobile. Along the way I had the opportunity to be granted a patent(co-inventor) in distributed systems, publish in a top academic journal and contribute to open-source software. I have recently also been very active as a speaker in ML/Tech conferences and meetups. I co-founded two tech startups earlier in my career.
