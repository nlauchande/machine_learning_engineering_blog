# About

Software & Machine Learning  Engineering [ Scala , Python, Java, Apache Spark, Hadoop, AWS, Open Source Contributor, TensorFlow, Keras, SKLearn, Catboost, XGBoost, FastAI ]  w/ 10+ years of  professional experience.  Currently tackling problems in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Distributed Systems.

US Patent Office registered  inventor  with a patent in the area of  distributed systems/cloud computing - US9674275 - (http://patents.justia.com/inventor/natu-lauchande). Over the years i  have contributed to code  on a few Open Source projects including among others an Apache top level leading machine learning engine ( Apache PredictionIO) and Apache Fineract ( when called Mifos 1.X ) . In a previous season of my career had lot's of fun co-founding 2 startups in the software and mobile data spaces and built from scratch the initial software product offering.

Did spent a big deal of my teens immersed in competitive programming  and mathematics competitions having the opportunity to participate in advanced training camps for top contestants nationwide in high school Maths/CS  competitions ( Number Theory, Discrete mathematics, Graph Algorithms, Problem Solving, Theorem Proving and Programming ) . Highlights :  Part of the mozambican national squad selected to the International Olympiad in Informatics, 3rd place in the Maths National Olympiad. After "retiring" from high school competitive programming was invited to consult with the organising committee as a problem author and jury member of the final national competition during the next four years after my last year of active competition. I seldom participate in online programming/ml competitions ( Google Code Jam, Topcoder, Zindi) for fun.
 
Current  focus/interests :

- Distributed Systems :  Reactive Systems,  Cloud Serverless Architectures/FAAS ( AWS Lambda), Scaling, Monitoring and Observability 
- Data Engineering : Stream Processing, Elastic Data Pipelines, Tools :   [Spark | Flink | Beam | Kafka | NIFI | AWS EMR ] 
- Machine Learning Engineering :  low latency prediction APIs, real time training data quality monitoring,  E2E Machine Learning Systems, Deep Learning E2E solution
