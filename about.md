Currently a Principal Engineer @ Jumo.World - has been tackling problems in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Distributed Systems in the  Data  teams at Jumo for the last 3 years . 

On his free time he volunteers for Omdena challenges as a Mentor and Lead Machine Learning Engineer for AI Challenges.  

Before joining Jumo.World spent time building  the Machine Learning backend of Locafox, a Berlin based startup  in Apache Spark and Scala. Natu also spent a good couple of  years on the AWS EC2 team in Cape Town helping build EC2 services and real-time monitoring as a Software Development Engineer. In the early days of his career had engineering exposure to l 
Biomedical/Bioinformatics space for clinical trials.


Along the way had the opportunity to be granted a patent(co-inventor) in distributed systems while working at Amazon (https://patents.google.com/patent/US9674275B1/en) , publish in a top academic journal( https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/5/1309/621438) and contribute to open-source software.
